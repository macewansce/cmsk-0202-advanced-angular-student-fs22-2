## Why do we Need Testing?
Simply put, testing helps us check whether our application is working as expected or not.
 
Your instructor has already prepared examples testing some of the code we have written so far in this course and the previous Angular course.
 
We will be following the Angular official documentations to test some of the code we have written.

## Installation of Module 04 - Lesson 01
 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.
 
### Development Server
 
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
 
### Code Scaffolding
 
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
 
### Build
 
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
 
### Running Unit Tests
 
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
 
### Running End-to-End Tests
 
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
 
### Further Help
 
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
